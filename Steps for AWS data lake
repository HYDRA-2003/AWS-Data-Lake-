Steps to visualise the data:

1.Crawler Runs
Put the data in the S3 bucket and run the crawler.
Crawler will create a tale to view the data
Use AWS Athena to run some queries on the table


2.ETL Transformation

In this step, Use AWS Glue.
AWS glue will help us to transfrom the data based on filters.
Necessary fileds can be taken from the table and a new table can be created.

3.AWS Quicksight

Here, the final data will be given as input and the data wil be visusalised.
Many insights can be gathered through this data.
